**Author**: [Suman Gautam](mailto:smngeo@gmail.com)

## Overview

Using LSTM and GRU network to perform sentiment classification from Twitter data


## Project Summary

Tanzanian Ministry of Water wants invest X amount of money on improving the water supply in their country. In order to do that, they want to identify the wells that needs immediate attention. They want to find out the number of wells from a newly collected test sites that are dysfunctional or needs repairs. Based on this, they want to focus on the following issues:

1. Identify region with large number of non-functioning water pump
2. Prioritize the region large group of people is being affected from the failed pumps. 
3. Identify the attribute types of the pumps that led to most of the failures

## Data

The datasets for this project is provided by [drivendata.org](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/). The dataset includes more than 60,000 water pump locations containing 40 features(10 numerical and 30 categorical). The description of the columns can be found in the link above.
