# Brand_Sentiment_Analysis_with_NLP

**Author**: [Suman Gautam](mailto:smngeo@gmail.com)

## Overview

Using LSTM and GRU network to perform sentiment classification from Twitter data


## Project Summary

X-Insight is an analytical company which provides analytical solutions to the major companies regarding there products, market analysis, sales analysis. Pine-Apple has hired X-insight to perform a large-scale market sentiment analysis on their products. 
In order to perform such analysis, X-insight is relying on Machine Learning to predict public sentiment from text data. For this purpose, X-insight is looking into twitter text data to predict if the given text has positive or negative sentiment towards a particular brand. More importantly, they want to test whether the project is feasible to invest more on large scale data collection and modelling. 


## Data

The datasets for this project is provided by [data.world](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions). The dataset includes twitter text related to Apple and Google products with user sentiment ranked between 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral', and 'no_idea' sentiments.
